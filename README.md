# War-19 | 2D Platform Shooter with Voice Recognition
This game was developed in Unity as a project for a subject in University and its main goal was to implement new types of natural interfaces in a "modern" videogame. We aimed to make a videogame that not only satisfied this requirement, but was also fun to play. 
Since our team was composed of many talented individuals we tried to make everything we could on our own and this includes:
- Game sprites and animations.
- UI.
- Map building.
- Coding.
- Storyboard and damage balacing

Even though we did have to see some tutorials to make some things work, we believe that we achieved our objective of making all of it, or the most of it, by ourselves.

<h3>Story & Requirements:</h3>
The game tells the story of a former scientist named "Sky" who tries to stop a former colleague of hers from releasing a deadly virus into theatmosphere. To do this, "Sky" must go through several levels, neutralizing the various minions who are trying to protect their master (Sky's former colleague)until she finally manages to confront him in a duel. To play the game, you need a keyboard to move the character character and a microphone to be able to use voice recognition that has several uses within the game.
We developed a menu that allows the user to
to resume the game at the last level you played, the game controls (in the options section), replay levels you have already played levels you have already played (in the levels section), or to exit the game


<h1>Attention!</h1>
Our voice recognition algorithm will only work if you are playing on a <b>Windows 10</b> computer with the language set to <b>English</b> and with <b>cortana</b> available.
